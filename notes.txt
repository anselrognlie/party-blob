remote uses fluxbox as window manager- neat

intro.md
========
- is there a way to force external links to open in a new tab/window?
- how will students be evaluated? is this a manual check or can any test be supplied?
  - can we abstract the pygame stuff enough for there to be meaningful tests?
  - can we make use of the blob object directly?
  - in some ways this feels like it would be ideally presented as a lab activity where teams could just be checked off as done. Do we have a model for that with remote learning?

part 1 (intro)
https://pythonprogramming.net/object-oriented-programming-introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/
======
- I'm annoyed the tutorial doesn't say in which file to create the Blob class
- I'm annoyed that the file doesn't have the proper imports to be runnable (briefly mentioned at 5:24, not at all in text)
- doesn't define WIDTH/HEIGHT, says he'll bring them in and explains what they are, but really??? (and not mentioned in text)

part 2 (OOP w/pygame)
https://pythonprogramming.net/creating-pygame-environment-intermediate-python-tutorial/
======
- arg! it's all in main???
- at least the imports are set
- RGB tuples
- suggest a smaller width/height to display better in repl
- the update comes after the draw???
- why does the main own the logic for updating blobs?
- why does the main own the logic for drawing blobs?
- are students familiar with the __name__ check?

part 3 (many blobs)
https://pythonprogramming.net/many-blob-objects-intermediate-python-tutorial/
======
- uses list comprehensions, which aren't covered in the curriculum
- intermediate state of blue blob stuff is missing the updated call to draw_environment
- will students have already seen the `enumerate` function?
- why get the keys instead of the pairs during enumeration

part 4 (classes and OOP modularity)
https://pythonprogramming.net/class-object-modularity-intermediate-python-tutorial/
======
- perhaps confusing that the default tuple is in the argument list.  Students might think this is ok to do for lists/dicts (mutables) as well.
- leaves import random after moving Blob to separate file
- encourage students to experiment with calling/not calling check_bounds, having it be configurable (or not)

part 5 (inheritance)
https://pythonprogramming.net/inheritance-object-oriented-programming-intermediate-python-tutorial/
======
- puts BlueBlob in the main (not mentioned in text)
- imports aren't module style
- the BlueBlob as the derived class is a little silly
  - Suggest some other name that doesn't involve color
  - Implementation doesn't leverage overriding methods so the update method keeps needing to be revised
  - should just remove color from __init__ for derived type
  - minor changes required at instantiation
- derived __init__ need to use super (not covered in curriculum)
- color definitions are in main (move to colors.py)
  - some variable renaming required
- mentions multiple inheritance
- super considered super
  - https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOglTERPEo
- needs import random if in separate file
- move_fast is asymetric and causes blob to cluster
  - should use -5, 6 for the range

part 6 (decorators)
https://pythonprogramming.net/decorators-intermediate-python-tutorial/
=======
- this has literally nothing to do with OOP
- and where did the blobs go
- to be fair, the lesson is no longer labeled OOP
  - the curriculum /does/ cover decorators already, and while this might help students remember that, it's so disconnected from everything else I question the value

part 7 (operator overloading)
https://pythonprogramming.net/operator-overloading-intermediate-python-tutorial/
=======
- jettisons use of color constants and doesn't add green
- using __add__ in this way is awful, especially since it breaks common assumptions about + that it doesn't modify the arguments
- when consuming a green blob, that other blob should really be destroyed, not just reduced to 0
- when reduced by a red blob, the blue shouldn't go negative, and should be destroyed at 0
- the end of this tutorial has some weirdly formatted prints (including a missig closing paren)
- the idea of blob interaction is good, but presenting it with operator overloading is awful
- collision detection is deferred to the following tutorial (not linked in the lesson)
  - https://pythonprogramming.net/detecting-collisions-intermediate-python-tutorial/?completed=/operator-overloading-intermediate-python-tutorial/

part 8 (special methods, OOP, iteration)
https://pythonprogramming.net/special-methods-iteration-intermediate-python-tutorial/
========
- starts with very strange detour in iterators and generators
  - uses some list comprehension examples
- this whole section, like the decorators, is completely divorced from the party blobs example
- recommend dropping
