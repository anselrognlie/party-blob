remote uses fluxbox as window manager

intro.md
========
- is there a way to force external links to open in a new tab/window?

part 1 (intro)
======
- I'm annoyed the tutorial doesn't say in which file to create the Blob class
- I'm annoyed that the file doesn't have the proper imports to be runnable (briefly mentioned at 5:24, not at all in text)
- doesn't define WIDTH/HEIGHT, says he'll bring them in and explains what they are, but really??? (and not mentioned in text)

part 2 (OOP w/pygame)
======
- arg! it's all in main???
- at least the imports are set
- RGB tuples
- suggest a smaller width/height to display better in repl
- the update comes after the draw???
- are students familiar with the __name__ check?

part 3 (many blobs)
======
- uses list comprehensions, which aren't covered in the curriculum
- intermediate state of blue blob stuff is missing the updated call to draw_environment
- will students have already seen the `enumerate` function?
- why get the keys instead of the pairs during enumeration

part 4 (classes and OOP modularity)
======
- perhaps confusing that the default tuple is in the argument list.  Students might think this is ok to do for lists/dicts (mutables) as well.
- leaves import random after moving Blob to separate file
- encourage students to experiment with calling/not calling check_bounds, having it be configurable (or not)

part 5 (inheritance)
======
- puts BlueBlob in the main (not mentioned in text)
- imports aren't module style
- the BlueBlob as the derived class is a little silly
  - Suggest some other name that doesn't involve color
  - Implementation doesn't leverage overriding methods so the update method keeps needing to be revised
- derived __init__ need to use super (not covered in curriculum)
- color definitions are in main (move to colors.py)
  - some variable renaming required
- mentions multiple inheritance
- super considered super

- needs import random if in separate file
- move_fast is asymetric and causes blob to cluster
  - should use -5, 6 for the range

part 6 (decorators)
=======
- this has literally nothing to do with OOP
- and where did the blobs go
- to be fair, the lesson is no longer labeled OOP
  - the curriculum /does/ cover decorators already, and while this might help students remember that, it's so disconnected from everything else I question the value
